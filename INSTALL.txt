INSTALLATION
------------

1. Place the shadowbox directory in your modules directory

2. Download the 'full' Shadowbox distribution:
   http://mjijackson.com/shadowbox/download.php?full

3. Extract the download, rename the shadowbox-1.x directory to just 'shadowbox'
   and place it in the shadowbox module directory

4. Enable the Shadowbox module

5. Visit the Shadowbox configuration page to review the settings
   (admin/settings/shadowbox)

USAGE
-----

Currently, to activate Shadowbox for a link, you must manually inject the
required attribute. To open any link in shadowbox you need to add a rel
attribute with a value of shadowbox (for compatibility with Lightbox you can
also use a value of lightbox). Depending on your specific needs you may need to
inject the required attribute in the theme layer.

Single image
------------

The important thing to note here is the rel attribute. This tells Shadowbox you
wish to activate it for this link. The title attribute is optional and can be
used to give a caption to the instance.

  <a href="/files/image.jpg" title="Caption" rel="shadowbox">Click me</a>

Multiple instances (gallery mode)
---------------------------------

Media can be grouped into a gallery using shadowbox[name] where name is any name
you wish to apply. The value of [name] is only used internally by Shadowbox and
won't be shown to the user.

  <a href="/files/image1.jpg" title="Caption 1" rel="shadowbox[gallery]">Image</a>
  <a href="/files/image2.jpg" title="Caption 2" rel="shadowbox[gallery]">Image</a>
  <a href="/files/image3.jpg" title="Caption 3" rel="shadowbox[gallery]">Image</a>

External URL
------------

A powerful feature of Shadowbox is the ability to open web pages directly on top
of the current page. Try out the example and see how the site still functions as
normal on top of the originating page.

  <a href="http://google.com" title="Google" rel="shadowbox">Google</a>

Advanced usage
--------------

Shadowbox allows you to specify options on a per-instance basis by using a
JSON-formatted parameter. More information on this feature can be found on the
Shadowbox usage page: http://mjijackson.com/shadowbox/doc/usage.html#markup
