INSTALLATION
------------

1. Follow the usual module installation procedure [1].
2. Download the Shadowbox 2.0 Full distribution [2].
3. Extract the download, rename the shadowbox-2.0 directory to just 'shadowbox'
   and place it inside the shadowbox module directory.
4. Visit the status page [3] to check Shadowbox is installed correctly.
5. Visit the settings page [4] to review the global settings.

If you are experiencing any problems getting Shadowbox to work try clearing the
cache using devel.module [5].

Note: Translations for the Shadowbox interface are currently handled by files
in the shadowbox/shadowbox/build/lang directory. If your site uses German,
Portuguese or Chinese translations you will need to copy and rename one of the
related language files to e.g. shadowbox-de.js. If a language file is not found
for the current language you will receive an error message.

USAGE
-----

This module integrates with imagefield, imagecache and views to provide the
same field formatter options as those available in the excellent lightbox2
module [6].

Note: You need to install imagecache to see display options for fields in
nodes and views.

To manually activate Shadowbox for a link, you must inject the required rel
attribute. To open any link in Shadowbox just add a rel attribute with a
value of shadowbox (for compatibility with lightbox2 you can also use a value
of lightbox). Depending on your specific needs you may need to inject the
required attribute at the theme layer.

Single Media Item

The important thing to note here is the rel attribute. This tells Shadowbox you
wish to activate it for this link. The title attribute is optional and can be
used to give a caption to the item.

  Exmaple:

  <a href="image.jpg" title="Caption" rel="shadowbox">Image</a>

Gallery

Media of mixed type can be grouped into a gallery using shadowbox[name] where
'name' is any value you wish to use for the current grouping of media. The
value of 'name' is only used internally by Shadowbox and won't be shown to the
user.

  Example:

  <a href="image1.jpg" title="Caption 1" rel="shadowbox[gallery]">Image 1</a>
  <a href="image2.jpg" title="Caption 2" rel="shadowbox[gallery]">Image 2</a>
  <a href="image3.jpg" title="Caption 3" rel="shadowbox[gallery]">Image 3</a>

iFrame

A useful feature of Shadowbox is the ability to open another website directly
on top of the current page.

  Example:

  <a href="http://google.com" title="Google" rel="shadowbox">Google</a>

Advanced Usage

Shadowbox allows you to specify options on a per-instance basis by using a
JSON-formatted parameter. More information on this feature can be found on the
Shadowbox usage page: http://mjijackson.com/shadowbox/doc/usage.html#markup

  Example:

  <a href="http://google.com" rel="shadowbox;width=740;height=380;
    options={overlayOpacity:1,resizeDuration:0.2};">Google</a>
