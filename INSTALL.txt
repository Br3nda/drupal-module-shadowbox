INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Follow the usual module installation procedure [1] or use Drush.

2. Download Shadowbox 3.0 from http://www.shadowbox-js.com/download.html.
   Both build and source versions work fine.

3. Extract the download and place it in sites/all/plugins so you have, for
   example: sites/all/plugins/shadowbox-build-3.0b

4. View the status report at admin/logs/status to check that Shadowbox is
   installed correctly.

5. Visit admin/settings/shadowbox to adjust the settings.


COMMAND LINE USERS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

drush dl shadowbox
drush enable shadowbox
mkdir sites/all/plugins
cd sites/all/plugins
wget http://freestylesystems.co.uk/files/shadowbox-build-3.0b.tar
tar xf shadowbox-build-3.0b.tar
rm shadowbox-build-3.0b.tar


OPTIONAL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install checkall and multicolumncheckboxesradios modules. They enhance the
admin settings form only.


TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- If you are experiencing any problems getting Shadowbox to work try clearing
  the cache.

- Check that the link you expect to open in Shadowbox has the required rel
  attribute with a value of 'shadowbox' or 'lightbox':
  <a href="/path/to/file.jpg" rel="shadowbox">

- Translations for the Shadowbox interface are currently handled by JS files in
  the languages sub-directory of the downloaded Shadowbox distribution. If your
  site uses a language that is not already catered for, you will need to copy, 
  edit and rename one of the related language files to suit your site.

  If a language file is not found for the current language you will receive an
  error message.

- Check the page in Firefox with Firebug's Console enabled. If there is a
  JavaScript error it will be flagged up in the bottom right hand corner of the
  Firefox window.
  
  It is helpful to provide the error message in any issue posts you might make.

- Check the issue queue to see if anyone has posted information about the same
  issue you are experiencing. Don't forget to check the issue queue before
  starting to create a patch for a module as someone might have already done
  most of the work for you.

- Finally, once you have done all you can to try and fix the problem yourself,
  you may post an new issue in the queue. Please include all the details you
  can think of that might be relevant to the issue. It helps to have a
  meaningful title that concisely expresses the scope of the issue. Provide any
  relevant debugging information you might have.


USAGE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module integrates with imagefield, imagecache and views to provide the
same field formatter options as those available in the excellent lightbox2
module [6].

Note: You need to install imagecache to see display options for fields in
nodes and views.

To manually activate Shadowbox for a link, you must inject the required rel
attribute. To open any link in Shadowbox just add a rel attribute with a
value of shadowbox (for compatibility with lightbox2 you can also use a value
of lightbox). Depending on your specific needs you may need to inject the
required attribute at the theme layer.

Single Media Item

The important thing to note here is the rel attribute. This tells Shadowbox you
wish to activate it for this link. The title attribute is optional and can be
used to give a caption to the item.

  Example:

  <a href="image.jpg" title="Caption" rel="shadowbox">Image</a>

Gallery

Media of mixed type can be grouped into a gallery using shadowbox[name] where
'name' is any value you wish to use for the current grouping of media. The
value of 'name' is only used internally by Shadowbox and won't be shown to the
user.

  Example:

  <a href="image1.jpg" title="Caption 1" rel="shadowbox[gallery]">Image 1</a>
  <a href="image2.jpg" title="Caption 2" rel="shadowbox[gallery]">Image 2</a>
  <a href="image3.jpg" title="Caption 3" rel="shadowbox[gallery]">Image 3</a>

iFrame

A useful feature of Shadowbox is the ability to open another website directly
on top of the current page.

  Example:

  <a href="http://google.com" title="Google" rel="shadowbox">Google</a>

Advanced Usage

Shadowbox allows you to specify options on a per-instance basis by using a
JSON-formatted parameter. More information on this feature can be found on the
Shadowbox usage page: http://www.shadowbox-js.com/usage.html

  Example:

  <a href="http://google.com" rel="shadowbox;width=740;height=380;
    options={overlayOpacity:1,resizeDuration:0.2};">Google</a>
